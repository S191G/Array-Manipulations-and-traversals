# Array Traversals , Manipilations
# Java Array Operations

This project contains various basic Java programs to perform operations on arrays. These examples are useful for beginners to understand how arrays work in Java.

## 📌 Programs Included

### 1. 🔄 Rotate Array by One Position

- **Right Rotation:** Last element moves to the front.
- Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → [5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`


### 2. ➕ Insert Element at Specific Position

- Inserts an element at a specified index.
- Since Java arrays are fixed size, a new array is created.
- Example: Insert `25` at index `2` in `[10, 20, 30, 40]` → `[10, 20, 25, 30, 40]`

### 3. ➖ Delete Element at Specific Position

- Removes an element by index.
- A new array is created without the deleted element.
- Example: Delete index `2` in `[10, 20, 30, 40, 50]` → `[10, 20, 40, 50]`

### 4. 🔁 Swap Alternate Elements

- Swaps every pair of elements (i.e., `0↔1`, `2↔3`, etc.)
- Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] → [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 5]`
